not likely to be repeated imho avoiding issues like this that balance a piece of sw from very good to excellent. at best this could discover some weird inner problem at worst there s no problem to care about. we ll i was on . . . using toi git as of th feb. i had been using that layout for some days and yesterday i wanted to hibernate and had a lot of problems apparently for lack of memory. i started to close apps while retrying i closed some more apps. i finally got it to hibernate and i attach the syslog of the situation. problem is that when i tried to resume this morning system got stuck on searching tuxonice... and i managed to get this backtrace tuxonice block io do bio wait x autoremove wake function x tuxonice block io set throttle x tuxonice block io toi rw buffer x

not likely to be repeated imho avoiding issues like this that balance a piece of sw from very good to excellent. at best this could discover some weird inner problem at worst there s no problem to care about. we ll i was on . . . using toi git as of th feb. i had been using that layout for some days and yesterday i wanted to hibernate and had a lot of problems apparently for lack of memory. i started to close apps while retrying i closed some more apps. i finally got it to hibernate and i attach the syslog of the situation. problem is that when i tried to resume this morning system got stuck on searching tuxonice... and i managed to get this backtrace tuxonice block io do bio wait x autoremove wake function x tuxonice block io set throttle x tuxonice block io toi rw buffer x

on languages methodologies and development tools for multi agent systems URL PLACEHOLDER part of mallow a federation of workshops on multi agent logics languages and organisations september durham united kingdom aim and scope this workshop is dedicated to formal approaches programming languages tools and techniques that support the development of multi agent systems. lads aims to address both theoretical and practical issues related to developing and deploying multi agent systems and promotes the discussion and exchange of ideas concerning concepts methodologies techniques and principles that are important for multi agent programming technology and application in areas such as the electronic institutions semantic web web services security grid computing ambient intelligence pervasive computing and electronic contracting. this workshop welcomes submissions of original papers concerning all aspects of multi agent development and deployment. topics include but are not limited to programming languages for multi agent systems extensions of traditional languages for multi agent programming semantics for multi agent programming languages implementation of social and organisational aspects of mas modal and epistemic logics for agent modelling model checking agents and multi agent systems algorithms for multi agent issues e.g. coordination cooperation negotiation distributed constraint satisfaction declarative approaches to engineering agent systems declarative models of agent beliefs and capabilities declarative models of bounded rationality declarative paradigms for the combination of heterogeneous agents specification and verification logics logic programming approaches to agent systems methodologies for mas analysis and design agent oriented requirements analysis and specification theoretical and practical aspects of multi agent programming computational complexity of mas high level executable multi agent specification languages agent communication in multi agent programming implementation of social and organisational aspects of mas agent development tools and platforms generic tools and infrastructures for multi agent programming

multi agent logics languages and organisations september durham united kingdom aim and scope this workshop is dedicated to formal approaches programming languages tools and techniques that support the development of multi agent systems. lads aims to address both theoretical and practical issues related to developing and deploying multi agent systems and promotes the discussion and exchange of ideas concerning concepts methodologies techniques and principles that are important for multi agent programming technology and application in areas such as the electronic institutions semantic web web services security grid computing ambient intelligence pervasive computing and electronic contracting. this workshop welcomes submissions of original papers concerning all aspects of multi agent development and deployment. topics include but are not limited to programming languages for multi agent systems extensions of traditional languages for multi agent programming semantics for multi agent programming languages implementation of social and organisational aspects of mas modal and epistemic logics for agent modelling model checking agents and multi agent systems algorithms for multi agent issues e.g. coordination cooperation negotiation distributed constraint satisfaction declarative approaches to engineering agent systems declarative models of agent beliefs and capabilities

i know the issue i ve had is not likely to be repeated imho avoiding issues like this that balance a piece of sw from very good to excellent. at best this could discover some weird inner problem at worst there s no problem to care about. we ll i was on . . . using toi git as of th feb. i had been using that layout for some days and yesterday i wanted to hibernate and had a lot of problems apparently for lack of memory. i started to close apps while retrying i closed some more apps. i finally got it to hibernate and i attach the syslog of the situation. problem is that when i tried to resume this morning system got stuck on searching tuxonice... and i managed to get this backtrace tuxonice block io do bio wait x autoremove wake function x tuxonice block io set throttle x tuxonice

more apps. i finally got it to hibernate and i attach the syslog of the situation. problem is that when i tried to resume this morning system got stuck on searching tuxonice... and i managed to get

my vbg was a more invasive form of a lap band that put a hole in my stomach and then a metal band around to create restriction that is still in place today my surgeon actually used the staple line and extended it along the greater curvature of the stomach and then removed the excess stomach. so on top of the ds bpd i have banding too. i feel blessed to have been able to have the ds and look forward to all the steps along the way and the learning. you must find what makes you happy and it seems that since you have the mo to year window for coverage really spend time reading the forums and doing your research you are who has to live with it you have to control it and all the functions it will change in your life once you know what is right for you there will be no stopping you and you will know it is the right thing for you. sorry so long and rambling but just felt i have stayed quiet for a long time just hiding in the wings holding my breathe in case it never happened and now that i am on the other side i feel free and complete for the first time in a long long time. sincerely brenda howard looking for last minute shopping deals? find them fast with yahoo!

my vbg was a more invasive form of a lap band that put a hole in my stomach and then a metal band around to create restriction that is still in place today my surgeon actually used the staple line and extended it along the greater curvature of the stomach and then removed the excess stomach. so on top of the ds bpd i have banding too. i feel blessed to have been able to have the ds and look forward to all the steps along the way and the learning. you must find what makes you happy and it seems that since you have the mo to year window for coverage really spend time reading the forums and doing your research you are who has to live with it you have to control it and all the functions it will change in your life once you know what is right for you there will be no stopping you and you will know it is the right thing for you. sorry so long and rambling but just felt i have stayed quiet for a long time just hiding in the wings holding my breathe in case it never happened and now that i am on the other side i feel free and complete for the first time in a long long time. sincerely brenda howard looking for last minute shopping deals? find them fast with yahoo!
